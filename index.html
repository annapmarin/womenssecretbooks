  <h3 id="Why_reading">Why reading women?</h3>
  <p>Reading female authors is important for several reasons. First, it can help promote equity and women visibility in the publishing industry. Often, the works of female authors are undervalued and have less visibility compared to those of male authors. By reading female authors, you can support them and help increase visibility of their works, which can contribute to greater representation of women in the publishing industry.</p>

<p>Second, reading female authors can help expand our literary horizons and have a more diverse and representative perspective. Women have had different experiences and perspectives than men, and this is reflected in their writing. By reading female authors, you can gain a deeper understanding of life and the world. Additionally, the works of female authors often tackle themes and issues that are important to women and are often ignored or underrepresented in literature.</p>
